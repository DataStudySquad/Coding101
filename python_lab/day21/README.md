# Day 21: Week 3 Review - Personal Finance Manager

Welcome to the final day of Week 3! Today we're bringing together everything we've learned about functions, modules, file handling, and error handling to create a comprehensive Personal Finance Manager. This project will demonstrate how all these concepts work together in a real-world application.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will have:
- Applied all Week 3 concepts in a single, cohesive project
- Created a professional-grade application with proper error handling
- Demonstrated mastery of functions, modules, file operations, and exception handling
- Built something genuinely useful for personal financial management
- Practiced code organization and documentation

## 📚 Week 3 Concept Review

Before diving into our final project, let's review what we've learned:

### Day 15: Function Basics
- **Definition**: `def function_name(parameters):`
- **Parameters**: Input values that functions can accept
- **Return Values**: Output that functions provide back
- **Key Insight**: Functions are like specialized tools that take inputs and produce outputs

```python
def calculate_monthly_payment(principal, interest_rate, months):
    """Calculate monthly loan payment"""
    monthly_rate = interest_rate / 12
    payment = principal * (monthly_rate * (1 + monthly_rate)**months) / ((1 + monthly_rate)**months - 1)
    return payment
```

### Day 16: Advanced Functions
- **Default Parameters**: `def greet(name, greeting="Hello")`
- **Variable Scope**: Local vs global variables
- **\*args and \*\*kwargs**: Flexible parameter handling
- **Lambda Functions**: Short, anonymous functions

```python
def process_transaction(amount, transaction_type, category=None, **details):
    """Process a financial transaction with flexible parameters"""
    # Function can handle various transaction details
    pass
```

### Day 17: Built-in Functions
- **Basic Functions**: `len()`, `max()`, `min()`, `sum()`
- **Advanced Functions**: `map()`, `filter()`, `sorted()`
- **Statistical Operations**: Processing collections of data

```python
# Calculate total expenses by category
expenses = [100, 250, 75, 300, 150]
total_expenses = sum(expenses)
max_expense = max(expenses)
sorted_expenses = sorted(expenses, reverse=True)
```

### Day 18: Modules and Packages
- **Importing**: `import module_name`, `from module import function`
- **Standard Library**: `datetime`, `json`, `os`, `random`, `math`
- **Code Organization**: Separating functionality into modules

```python
import json
import datetime
from pathlib import Path

# Use modules for different aspects of the application
```

### Day 19: File Handling
- **Reading Files**: `with open(filename, 'r') as file:`
- **Writing Files**: `with open(filename, 'w') as file:`
- **JSON Operations**: `json.load()`, `json.dump()`
- **Path Handling**: Using `pathlib` for robust file operations

```python
def save_financial_data(data, filename):
    """Save financial data to JSON file"""
    with open(filename, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        json.dump(data, file, indent=2)
```

### Day 20: Error Handling
- **try/except Blocks**: Graceful error handling
- **Specific Exceptions**: `FileNotFoundError`, `ValueError`, `KeyError`
- **Error Recovery**: Fallback strategies and retry mechanisms
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear communication when things go wrong

```python
def load_financial_data(filename):
    """Load financial data with error handling"""
    try:
        with open(filename, 'r') as file:
            return json.load(file)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("No previous data found. Starting fresh.")
        return {"transactions": [], "budgets": {}}
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        print("Data file corrupted. Creating backup and starting fresh.")
        return {"transactions": [], "budgets": {}}
```

## 💰 Today's Project: Personal Finance Manager

### Project Overview

We're building a comprehensive Personal Finance Manager that includes:

1. **Transaction Management**: Add, edit, delete, and categorize transactions
2. **Budget Tracking**: Set budgets for different categories and track spending
3. **Financial Reports**: Generate spending summaries and budget analyses
4. **Data Persistence**: Save and load data using JSON files
5. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for all operations
6. **User Interface**: Clean, menu-driven interface

### Key Features

- **Income and Expense Tracking**: Record all financial transactions
- **Category Management**: Organize transactions by category (food, transport, entertainment, etc.)
- **Budget Setting**: Set monthly budgets and track against actual spending
- **Reporting**: Generate monthly/yearly financial summaries
- **Data Export**: Export data to different formats (CSV, JSON)
- **Search and Filter**: Find specific transactions or analyze spending patterns
- **Backup and Recovery**: Automatic backups with error recovery

### Architecture Overview

Our application will be structured using all the concepts we've learned:
